# BIGRH
Many times College students get bored during lecture and can't follow through the lecture material. Not only students but even professor have to suffer because of that. So we are presenting Student Emotion Caluclator.

The big idea is to use live video feed of the lecture hall/room or take some pictures using webcam installed inside classes, then send that image or video feed to Microsoft Congnitive Emotion Recognization API to get report of the differet students present in the lecture. Then using a backend script to parse the report and give the overall emotion of the classroom to let professor know where to improve in their lecture.
